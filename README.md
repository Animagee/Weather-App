Before running this application, you'll need:

1. A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
2. A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `w.js` file in your text editor.

3. Locate the following line near the top of the file:
   ```javascript

4. Replace "YOUR API KEY" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. For example:
